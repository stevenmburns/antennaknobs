r"""80 m triangular skyloop run on 17 m, matched to 50 Ω with an L-network —
the `Shunt`-branch showcase for issue #65 (Q2, shunt-to-common).

Geometry is inherited wholesale from `triangular_skyloop`: the same corner-fed
equilateral full-wave loop, flown with the `Drone` and meshed off
`nominal_nsegs`. Cut for 80 m (~85 m perimeter, 1 λ at 3.8 MHz) but operated on
the 17 m band (18.1 MHz), that perimeter is ~4.7 λ and the corner feed is
wildly reactive (~225 − 70j here), nowhere near 50 Ω — the classic "loop +
tuner" multiband situation.

An **L-match** fixes it with two reactive elements. Because R_load > 50 Ω the
network is a shunt across the antenna feed plus a series element to the source:

    source ──[ series TwoPort: L ]── feed
                                      │
                              [ Shunt: C ]── common

The port spec drives a virtual `in` node, runs a series `TwoPort(in→feed)`, and
puts a `Shunt` across `feed` to the common reference; the impedance read at `in`
is the matched input Z. Stock values land it at ~50 Ω / SWR ≈ 1.0 at 18.1 MHz;
retune `series_L_uH` / `shunt_C_pF` for other bands or a different loop.

`Shunt` — a lumped R/L/C from a single port to the common reference — is the
element issue #65 deferred as Q2. A matching network was the motivating use
case; this design is it. The showcase is the impedance/SWR transform, which
the reducer computes exactly on top of the extracted antenna Y. The stock
coil has Q = 200 (`coil_q = 0` recovers the ideal one); unlike the
inverted-L's high-Q tee this match runs modest circulating current, so the
coil burns only ~1 % of the input power — visible in the power-budget
readout rather than dominating it.
