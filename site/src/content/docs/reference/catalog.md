description: The built-in antenna designs, by family — each one a readable AntennaBuilder you can copy as a starting point.
---

Every built-in design is an [`AntennaBuilder`](/concepts/model/) whose source is
meant to be read and copied. Address them as `family.name` (the same names
`python -m antennaknobs list` prints), and open any in the [live
simulator](https://app.antennaknobs.dev/) to drag its knobs. Many are modelled
after L. B. Cebik (W4RNL)'s articles.

## Dipoles

| Design | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `dipoles.invvee` | Inverted-vee dipole (the default quickstart example) |
| `dipoles.folded_invvee` | Folded inverted-vee |
| `dipoles.ocf_dipole` | Off-center-fed dipole (Windom) — a half-wave fed away from the middle |
| `dipoles.dipole_turnstile` | Crossed dipoles fed in phase quadrature |
| `dipoles.koch_dipole` | Koch fractal dipole |
| `dipoles.short_dipole_loaded` | Center-loaded shortened dipole (a Load-branch showcase) |

## Loops

The delta loop is the catalog's teaching showpiece — one loop laid out **four
ways**, all exposing the same knobs (`base`, `length_factor`, `angle_deg`) and
producing byte-identical wires. They differ only in *how you specify the
geometry*, from writing every corner as coordinates to flying the whole shape
with a `Drone` (see [Many ways to express geometry](/concepts/authoring/)):

| Design | Built by |
| --- | --- |
| `loops.delta_loop` | the shipped version: corner coordinates from a closed-form expression for the top corner |
| `loops.delta_loop_flyby` | full `Drone` (3D turtle) flyby; top laid by `forward_through_plane`, feed-anchored with a z-offset pass |
| `loops.delta_loop_reflected` | `Drone` point-finder + `ry` reflection + `build_path` (side solved for the perimeter) |
| `loops.delta_loop_topdown` | top-down flight: starts at the top, `forward_to_plane` lands the feed where the slant crosses `y = eps` |

Other loops: `loops.delta_loop_slanted`, `loops.inv_delta_loop`,
`loops.horizontal_loop` (full-wave "loop skywire") and its `Drone` twin
`loops.horizontal_loop_drone`, `loops.diamond_loop` (+ `diamond_loop_turnstile`),
`loops.quad` (2-element cubical quad beam), and `loops.bisquare` (a two-wavelength
broadside curtain).

## Beams

| Design | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `beams.yagi` | Yagi–Uda parasitic beam |
| `beams.moxon` | Moxon rectangle |

## Verticals

| Design | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `verticals.vertical` | Quarter-wave vertical |
| `verticals.raised_vertical` | Elevated vertical |
| `verticals.inverted_l` | Inverted-L, a bent top-loaded vertical |
| `verticals.jpole` | J-pole, end-fed half-wave with a quarter-wave matching stub |
| `verticals.half_square` | Half-square, a vertically-polarised wire antenna |
| `verticals.bobtail` | Bobtail curtain, a 3-element vertical broadside array |

## Wire antennas & curtains

| `wire.zepp` | End-fed half-wave "Zepp" with a tuned-stub feeder |

## Broadband

| Design | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `broadband.discone` | Discone, a broadband vertical (disc + cone) as a wire cage |
| `broadband.g5rv` | G5RV doublet with a matched-line section |
